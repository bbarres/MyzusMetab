## Context
Insecticide resistance can lead to the repeated application of treatments that are both ineffective in pest control and harmful for the environment. In order to establish sound strategies to slow down or limit these resistance phenomena, precise knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, their relative contribution and their potential interaction is essential. *Myzus persicae* is a major pest aphid, capable of infesting a wide range of crops, with significant economic impact. *M. persicae* is known to have evolved resistances to insecticides of different families, including the abundantly used neonicotinoids. *M. persicae* resistance to neonicotinoids has previously been described as being due to two main mechanisms: a P450 overexpression metabolic resistance and a target-site mutation, R81T, but their respective contribution to resistant phenotypes remains unclear. In this study we combined extensive bioassays with synergist on numerous clones, with gene copy number and expression quantification of two key P450 enzymes (*CYP6CY3* and *CYP6CY4*) to explain the observed phenotypes and assess the relative contribution of metabolic and target-site mechanisms to neonicotinoid resistance in *M. persicae*.
